### Getting Started

>The beginning of a directive is much like building a service in Angular. It is a modular piece of code that can be used anywhere in your app. 

##### First lets build the shell if the directive.

- First of all you define your agular directive just the same as an Angular service or controller. See its not so scary... 

- Now we will build the directive definition object. 

### Directive Definition Object. 

>A DDO or directive definition object is the hub of your directive. This is where everything that makes your directive what it is come together.

- Your DDO is comprised of directive properties. 
- The directive properties that we will be using in this app are as follows (We will be going over them later on)
-- Scope
-- Controller
-- Template URL
-- Restrict
